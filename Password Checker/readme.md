## This is a python script that will check if your password is safe or is been hacked!

_Here, we use the API provided by [this](https://haveibeenpwned.com/Passwords) website inorder to check if our passwords are safe or not_
_If the password you have entered is found to be hacked, the script will return the **number of times** the password is being used and yeah will suggest you to change the password!!_

#### How to use:
  * Download the script (_ofcourse_).
  * Open your favourite terminal.
  * Now run the following command 
  ```
  python3 main.py arg1 arg2 ... argN
  ```
   Replace  arg1 ~ argN with the passwords you wanna check!!
  * Enjoy!
